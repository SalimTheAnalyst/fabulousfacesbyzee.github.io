                </a></h2>
                <p>This capstone project is from the Google Data Analytics Certification Course offered by Coursera and accredited by Google.
                    In this case study, I will be working as a data analyst for CYCLISTIC, a bike-share company. CYCLISTIC wants to get insights and recommendations on how to convert their Casual riders into Yearly Membership riders. The company is based in Chicago, USA and has over 5,800 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.</p>

                                            <p>Nigeria's Presidential Elections was conducted on the 25th of february 2023. Citizens across the country went out to cast their votes for their preferred candidates. PDP's Atiku Abubakar, LP's Peter Obi and APC's Bola Ahmed tinubu are the 3 candidates projected to be at the forefront of the race. However, there is an argument, 'To what extent does Social media determine the outcome of an election ?'. All tweets with relevant hashtags related to each candidate was extracted from twitter on that election day (25/02/2023). Twitter #hashtag has decided !. Will there be a correlation with that of INEC, the electoral body?.</p>
